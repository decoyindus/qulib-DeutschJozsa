    "description": "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was the first example of a quantum algorithm that performs better than the best classical algorithm. It showed that there can be advantages to using a quantum computer as a computational tool for a specific problem.<br> We are given a hidden Boolean function f, which takes as input a string of bits, and returns either 0 or 1. The property of the given Boolean function is that it is guaranteed to either be balanced or constant. A constant function returns all 0s or all 1s for any input, while balanced returns 0s for exactly half of the inputs, and 1s for the other half. Using the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the question can be answered with just one function evaluation."
